# snow-elf-subrace

Hello my fellow yees and haws!

My name is Nerd Fairchild. I'm a very new to this whole coding thing but I'm trying. Also English is my second language so please let me know if you find any grammar mistakes I made so I can fix them.

I made this subrace for the elf race in Dungeons & Dragons 5e because I really liked this idea. Credit to starlightwalker who created this wonderful subrace. You can find the original version here: https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LnEO8C2rYXE4yA6il1V

I didn't change anything on this version. I just made it possible to use this subrace in Aurora Builder too.

I hope you'll like it and please let me know if you find any bugs or something else, so I can fix it.
